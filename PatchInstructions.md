# Set Initial Data

First We deal with The stuff that can later change at Runtime

We have the Ram Addresses for it, they Should not change but W/E, we have them
```
    '__data_start__':0x03002910,
    'Inventory':0x03002934,
    'InitializersLen':0x0300294c,
    'HardMode':0x0300294e,
    'ExtraChest':0x0300294f,
    'HammerMode':0x03002950,
```

It should be noted that Some of these get initialized with 
```
    # Section, AddressStart, Length, LoadAtMemoryROM
    ('.data',0x03002910,0x6b8,0x0803e8ac)
```

Meaning we calculate the difference to the base addres and Apply the Values at ROM 0x0803e8ac
```
    ('__data_start__',0x03002910,0x0,0x0803E8AC)
    ('Inventory',0x03002934,0x18,0x0803E8D0)
    ('InitializersLen',0x0300294c,0x02,0x0803E8E8)
    ('HardMode',0x0300294e,0x01,0x0803E8EA)
    ('ExtraChest',0x0300294f,0x01,0x0803E8EB)
    ('HammerMode',0x03002950,0x01,0x0803E8EC)
```

Now the Static Data at ROM

```
    ('Initializers',0x0803d28c,0xf0) # A single Initializer is 0x0f and has the Struct EInteractType, Better to build Programmatically
    ('humanTiles',0x08005224,0x200) # Eventually i wanna change this
    ('humanPal',0x08005424,0x10) # And if i do i would have to update this as well
```

fix initializer Override from WallTMetaInit at ROM 0x080007b2 from a3 52 to 1b 00

## Should no longer be reachable but JUST in case you CAN Disable the Modes to the correct Ones
